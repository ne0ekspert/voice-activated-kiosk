# AI Voice Recognition Kiosk

Graduation work of Busan Mechanical Technical High School project class

## Overview

Voice Recognition Kiosk is a kiosk system that allows users to **add or delete food items to their order** using only their voice and implements a payment system utilizing NFC.
It supports users to order and pay for food conveniently by using a screen implemented with React.js and Python and ChatGPT based **speech recognition and generative AI answer generation technology**.

## Features

* Add and delete food orders via voice recognition
* Display voice recognition results and generative AI answers
* Payment system utilizing NFC

## Technology stack

* Frontend: React.js
* Backend: Python, ChatGPT
* Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5, Sunfounder 10.1‚Äù touchscreen
* Other: PN532 NFC reader (I2C)

## Install and run

1. Clone the project. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ne0ekspert/voice-activated-kiosk.git`
2. Install the required libraries. pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the server with the command `python main.py`.
4. navigate to the address `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## How to use
